            <h2>App Description</h2>
            <p>Our website will look similar to MyPlan, as we will have basic information for each course (name, description, grade distribution, times, etc.) 
               directly from MyPlan. However, there will be additional information that is not on MyPlan, such as direct links to their Rate My Professor page 
               and which INFO specialization it is. Similar to MyPlan, students will be able to make schedules with the course and see them visually. They will 
               be able to log in with their netID and save their progress so that they can come back later. We will also implement a warning system, where the 
               website will tell you if your schedule is not recommended (based on the credit load/difficulty of classes). We will also have a review/rating 
               system where students can leave feedback on the classes. Lastly, we will have more useful filters for our course search (specialization, average 
               grade, best professor, etc.).
            </p>
            <p>In our experience, we have found that MyPlan can be confusing and hard to use. Our idea aims to minimize the time a student needs to spend on 
               MyPlan, and instead use our website to plan out their class schedules. In the best case scenario, a student would plan all of their INFO classes 
               for the quarter with our website, using our web app’s additional features to make more informed decisions. At the very least, our website can act 
               as a hub of resources about INFO classes to help students consider which class is right for them. For our web application, the main users would 
               be students who are Informatics majors. However, all students will have access to the website, so anyone taking Informatics classes can also use 
               the website. Because our web application will only have INFO classes, non-INFO majors would be less incentivized to use our website because you 
               can’t build full schedules with just the INFO planner.
